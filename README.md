This is a task manager application. Its major aim is to help users manage their tasks over time.
The application has features that allow users to add, delete, modify and check off the tasks.
It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Future enhancements of the application would include generating alerts when a task is due so that the user can keep time, and using the application to manage tasks among teams.
